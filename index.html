      <p>This is a website I made as practice in having videos repeating
      in the background.  There is a slight pause in the video and it is
      not fully functional.  However, it's a start!  I borrowed code from
      <a href="http://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/knqyK">Code Pen</a> to
      help with the process.</p>
